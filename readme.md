## Installation (Laravel 4.x - no longer actively supported)
Installation instructions for Laravel 4 can be [found here](https://github.com/cmgmyr/laravel-messenger/tree/v1).

## Installation (Laravel 5.x)
### Laravel 5.6+ onwards
```bash
composer require syntaxlexx/chatmessenger
```

### Laravel 5.1 > 5.5
```bash
composer require syntaxlexx/chatmessenger@1.0.8
```

Or place manually in composer.json:

```php
"require": {
    "syntaxlexx/chatmessenger": "^1.0"
}
```

Run:

```
composer update
```

#### >>> If using Laravel 5.4 and below
> **Note**: Laravel Messenger supports [Package Discovery](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/packages#package-discovery). If using Laravel 5.5 and above, skip this part.

Add the service provider to `config/app.php` under `providers`:

```php
'providers' => [
    Lexx\ChatMessenger\ChatMessengerServiceProvider::class,
],
```

Publish config:

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Lexx\ChatMessenger\ChatMessengerServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

Update config file to reference your User Model:

```php
config/chatmessenger.php
```

Create a `users` table if you do not have one already. If you need one, the default Laravel migration will be satisfactory.

**(Optional)** Define names of database tables in package config file if you don't want to use default ones:

```php
'messages_table' => 'lexx_messages',
'participants_table' => 'lexx_participants',
'threads_table' => 'lexx_threads',
```

Publish migrations:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Lexx\ChatMessenger\ChatMessengerServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

Migrate your database:

```
php artisan migrate
```

Add the trait to your user model:

```php
use Lexx\ChatMessenger\Traits\Messagable;

class User extends Authenticatable {
    use Messagable;
}
```

# Pusher Integration
This package utilizes [pusher/pusher-php-server](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-php-server)
that provides pusher services out-of-the-box. All you have to do is require the package, register the service providers, publish the vendor package, and that's it! You're good to go.

Please check out the examples section for a detailed example usage.

## Breaking Changes:
### Deprecated Packages
Since [Pusher Http Laravel](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-http-laravel) has been deprecated, the current 
demo uses the latest Laravel 5/6 trends of Broadcasting via events. Checkout [THE DEMO](https://github.com/syntaxlexx/laravel-5-messenger-demo)
to see it in action. It becomes more manageable and expressive to configure channels individually.
> If you plan to migrate to Laravel 6, the Pusher Http Laravel deprecated package will prohibit you due to dependency issues.
> You will simply need to create an event to fire the broadcast message, and a channel for broadcasting. You can check the demo 
>for practical usage.

### Migration to v1.2
As pointed out in this [issue](https://github.com/syntaxlexx/laravel-5-messenger/issues/10#issue-471480046), the starred
property has been moved from `threads` table to the `participants` table as it makes much more sense there. 
(Credits to [snarcraft](https://github.com/snarcraft)).
> run `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Lexx\ChatMessenger\ChatMessengerServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"` to copy migration file,
> then run `php artisan migrate`. 

Starring a thread is as easy as calling the `star()` method on the thread. If no userId is passed, it defaults to the currently logged-in user. 
Same case applied to unstarring a thread. `$thread->unstar()`.

> To get a clear picture of how it works, open two to four browsers (private/incognito mode is perfect for this case) and login with different accounts.
